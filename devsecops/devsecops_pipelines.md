# Overview of DevSecOps Pipelines

DevSecOps, short for Development, Security, and Operations, is a philosophy that integrates security practices within the DevOps process. DevSecOps pipelines are designed to automate and embed security at every phase of the software development lifecycle. The key stages:

1. **Planning and Analysis**
   - Identify security requirements and constraints.
   - Perform threat modeling to understand potential risks.
   - Define security policies and standards.

2. **Development and Coding**
   - Implement secure coding practices.
   - Use pre-approved security libraries and components.
   - Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**
   - Automate code scanning for vulnerabilities using Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
   - Run unit tests to ensure code quality.
   - Build artifacts securely and store them in a secure repository.

4. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**
   - Deploy code to staging or production environments using automated pipelines.
   - Utilize Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) to test running applications.
   - Ensure secure configuration management.

5. **Monitoring and Operations**
   - Monitor applications and infrastructure for security incidents.
   - Implement automated incident response.
   - Regularly update and patch systems.

6. **Feedback and Improvement**
   - Collect feedback on security performance.
   - Continuously improve security practices and tools.
   - Foster a culture of security awareness and collaboration.

The DevSecOps pipeline emphasizes collaboration between development, security, and operations teams, ensuring that security is not a bottleneck but an enabler of faster and more reliable software delivery.
