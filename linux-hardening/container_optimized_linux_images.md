1. **Alpine Linux**: Known for its small footprint, security features, and simplicity, Alpine Linux is a common choice for containerized applications. It's often used for Docker containers due to its size (typically around 5MB) and efficiency.

2. **CoreOS (Container Linux)**: CoreOS is a popular container-optimized OS with built-in support for Docker and Kubernetes. It features automatic updates and scalability features. However, as of May 2020, CoreOS has been discontinued and its functionalities have been integrated into Fedora CoreOS and Red Hat OpenShift.

3. **Fedora CoreOS**: Following the acquisition of CoreOS by Red Hat, Fedora CoreOS is its spiritual successor. It is designed for scalability and security, with automatic updates and rollbacks, as well as integration with Kubernetes.

4. **RancherOS**: RancherOS is a lightweight Linux distribution purpose-built for running Docker containers. It removes most of the traditional OS utilities and replaces them with Docker for both system and user services.

5. **Google's Container-Optimized OS (COS)**: COS is a lightweight, secure, and reliable operating system from Google. Designed specifically for running containerized applications on Google Cloud Platform, it features automatic updates, security enhancements, and a strong focus on running containers.

6. **Amazon Linux 2 (with ECS-Optimized AMI)**: This is a Linux server provided by Amazon for use in the AWS environment. It is tuned for optimal performance and can be used with the Elastic Container Service (ECS) for container deployment.

7. **Ubuntu Core**: Ubuntu Core, built by Canonical, is a minimal version of Ubuntu designed for IoT devices and large container deployments. It uses a transactional update mechanism that makes it well-suited for devices and distributed applications on Linux.

8. **Photon OS**: VMwareâ€™s Photon OS is a lightweight, container-optimized Linux operating system designed for cloud-native applications, cloud platforms, and VMware infrastructure.

Note that when choosing a container-optimized OS, you should consider factors such as the specific needs of your project, hardware requirements, the cloud platform you're using (if any), and your familiarity with the OS.
