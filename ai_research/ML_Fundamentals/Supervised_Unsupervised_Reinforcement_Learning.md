| Definition                  | A type of learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that the training data includes both input data and the corresponding correct outputs. | Learning from an unlabeled dataset, the model tries to find the underlying patterns and structures in the data. | A type of learning where the model learns to interact with an environment to achieve a goal or maximize some notion of cumulative reward. |
| Training Data               | Labeled data (features and labels)         | Unlabeled data (features only)             | Interaction with the environment, rewards based on actions. |
| Goal                        | To make accurate predictions or classifications based on the input data. | To find hidden patterns or groupings in the data. | To find a strategy to obtain the maximum cumulative reward over time. |
| Algorithms                  | Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks, etc. | Clustering (e.g., K-means), Association (e.g., Apriori), Principal Component Analysis, etc. | Q-learning, Deep Q Network (DQN), Policy Gradients, etc. |
| Real-world Applications     | Image recognition, Spam detection, Credit risk analysis, etc. | Market segmentation, Anomaly detection, Recommender systems, etc. | Autonomous vehicles, Game playing (like AlphaGo), Robotics, etc. |
| Evaluation Metrics          | Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, etc.| Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, etc. | Reward function, which may vary greatly depending on the specific task. |
