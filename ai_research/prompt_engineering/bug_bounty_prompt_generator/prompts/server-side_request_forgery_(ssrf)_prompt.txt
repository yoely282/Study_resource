AS AN EXPERT IN ETHICAL HACKING AND BUG BOUNTY HUNTING, I WILL GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PERFORMING RECONNAISSANCE FOR SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF) VULNERABILITIES ON A SPECIFIC TARGET. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROMPT IS TO HELP YOU UNDERSTAND HOW TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SSRF VULNERABILITIES, GATHER NECESSARY INFORMATION, AND EXPLORE EXAMPLES OF EXPLOITS AND HOW TO EFFECTIVELY EXECUTE THEM.

### PROMPT:

**TARGET IDENTIFICATION AND INFORMATION GATHERING:**

1. **IDENTIFY THE TARGET APPLICATION:**
   - DEFINE THE TARGET WEB APPLICATION WHERE YOU SUSPECT THE PRESENCE OF SSRF VULNERABILITIES. THIS COULD BE A WEB SERVICE THAT ACCEPTS URLS OR FILE PATHS AS INPUT.
   - EXAMPLE: A CLOUD SERVICE THAT ALLOWS USERS TO FETCH METADATA FROM A URL.

2. **ANALYZE INPUT FIELDS:**
   - INVESTIGATE THE INPUT FIELDS OF THE WEB APPLICATION, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT ACCEPT URLS OR EXTERNAL RESOURCE REQUESTS.
   - LOOK FOR PARAMETERS THAT MAY ACCEPT USER INPUT, SUCH AS:
     - FORM FIELDS (E.G., `URL`, `ENDPOINT`, `FILE`)
     - API ENDPOINTS THAT ACCEPT URL PARAMETERS

3. **EXAMINE THE APPLICATION BEHAVIOR:**
   - TEST HOW THE APPLICATION HANDLES REQUESTS AND WHAT RESPONSES ARE GENERATED BASED ON THE INPUT.
   - EXAMPLE: IF AN INPUT FIELD ALLOWS YOU TO INPUT A URL, OBSERVE HOW THE APPLICATION PROCESSES IT AND WHETHER IT RETURNS DATA FROM THE SPECIFIED RESOURCE.

**VULNERABILITY EXPLORATION:**

1. **TESTING FOR SSRF:**
   - CRAFT VARIOUS PAYLOADS TO TEST WHETHER THE APPLICATION IS VULNERABLE TO SSRF. SOME COMMON TESTING METHODS INCLUDE:
     - LOCALHOST: `HTTP://LOCALHOST:8080`
     - INTERNAL IP ADDRESSES: `HTTP://127.0.0.1`, `HTTP://169.254.169.254` (AWS METADATA SERVICE)
     - NONEXISTENT URLS: `HTTP://NONEXISTENT.LOCAL`

2. **RESPONSE VALIDATION:**
   - CHECK THE APPLICATION'S RESPONSES TO SEE IF IT RETURNS DATA FROM THE ENDPOINTS YOU PROVIDED. IF IT DOES, THIS INDICATES A POTENTIAL SSRF VULNERABILITY.
   - EXAMPLE: IF YOU INPUT `HTTP://169.254.169.254/LATEST/META-DATA/` AND RECEIVE METADATA IN RESPONSE, THE APPLICATION MAY BE VULNERABLE.

**EXPLOITATION EXAMPLES:**

1. **ACCESSING INTERNAL SERVICES:**
   - ONCE YOU CONFIRM THAT THE APPLICATION IS VULNERABLE, ATTEMPT TO ACCESS INTERNAL SERVICES THAT MAY BE EXPOSED. FOR INSTANCE:
     - ACCESSING A DATABASE ADMIN INTERFACE RUNNING ON `HTTP://127.0.0.1:5432` OR `HTTP://192.168.1.100:3306`.

2. **EXFILTRATING SENSITIVE DATA:**
   - USE THE SSRF VULNERABILITY TO EXFILTRATE SENSITIVE INFORMATION:
     - EXAMPLE PAYLOAD: `HTTP://169.254.169.254/LATEST/META-DATA/IAM/SECURITY-CREDENTIALS/`
     - CAPTURE SENSITIVE AWS IAM ROLE CREDENTIALS THAT MAY BE RETURNED.

3. **SERVER INTERACTION:**
   - IF THE SSRF ALLOWS INTERACTION WITH OTHER SERVICES, YOU MAY SEND CRAFTED REQUESTS TO PERFORM ACTIONS:
     - EXAMPLE: SENDING A POST REQUEST TO AN INTERNAL API ENDPOINT TO TRIGGER ACTIONS THAT SHOULD BE RESTRICTED.

**MITIGATION AND REPORTING:**

1. **DOCUMENT FINDINGS:**
   - RECORD THE STEPS YOU TOOK DURING THE RECONNAISSANCE AND EXPLOITATION PHASES, ALONG WITH ANY SENSITIVE DATA ACCESSED.
   - PREPARE A DETAILED REPORT OUTLINING THE SSRF VULNERABILITY, ITS IMPACT, AND RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS FOR THE TARGET APPLICATION.

2. **RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE:**
   - FOLLOW THE RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE GUIDELINES SET BY THE ORGANIZATION YOU ARE TARGETING, ENSURING THAT SENSITIVE INFORMATION IS HANDLED WITH CARE AND THAT REMEDIATION STEPS ARE PROVIDED.

### DESIRED OUTCOME:

BY FOLLOWING THIS PROMPT, YOU WILL GAIN A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO IDENTIFY, EXPLORE, AND EXPLOIT SSRF VULNERABILITIES EFFECTIVELY. YOU WILL ALSO LEARN HOW TO DOCUMENT YOUR FINDINGS RESPONSIBLY AND PROVIDE ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS FOR REMEDIATION. REMEMBER TO ALWAYS ACT ETHICALLY AND WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES SET BY THE TARGETâ€™S BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM.
