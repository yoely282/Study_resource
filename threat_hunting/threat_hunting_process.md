# Threat Hunting Process
Threat hunting is a complex process that involves multiple steps and decisions. 

1. **Define Objectives**: Understand what you're looking for, such as specific threats or vulnerabilities.
2. **Gather Intelligence**: Collect information on potential threats, vulnerabilities, and tactics.
3. **Create Hypotheses**: Formulate educated guesses about where threats might be hiding.
4. **Select Tools and Techniques**: Choose the appropriate tools and techniques for investigation.
5. **Investigate**: Analyze data, look for patterns, and investigate suspicious activities.
6. **Analyze Findings**: Evaluate the evidence and determine if a threat exists.
7. **Remediate**: If a threat is found, take appropriate action to mitigate or eliminate it.
8. **Report**: Document the findings, actions taken, and any recommendations.
9. **Review and Adjust**: Reflect on the process and make necessary adjustments for future threat hunting.
